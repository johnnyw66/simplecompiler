#I'm going to put a stop on this compiler:-

#I've now put in calls to other functions
#but missed difficult things like passing varibles to
#non-lib functions and local variables:-

#creating other external functions will be easy -
#but local vars and the like will take a
#lot more of my time.

#For something which is going to be produced
#by a `App Wizard` I think the syntax of this language has
#gone far enough.
#Below is code which shows how internal functions called.
